# blinkenlights-poster
A modern recreation of the classic "Blinkenlights" poster, as described in The Jargon File

I'm not particularly fluent in legalese, but I believe the original ideas and text of the
original "blinkenlights" poster to be in the public domain.

I have set this text in a more contemporary font to try and maintain its simplicity and
suitability in modern contexts. I have also made some slight adjustments to the wording
in the text to improve the tone and remove some dated, potentially insensitive language.

The document is available in ODT and PDF formats, in both US Letter and A4 paper sizes.

Both color and black and white versions have been produced.

I hope this brings the same joy to your server room as it does to mine. :)
